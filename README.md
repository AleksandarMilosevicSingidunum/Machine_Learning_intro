# Machine Learning and Data Analysis Examples

This repository contains examples of machine learning and data analysis using Python and various libraries. Each section focuses on a different topic and includes code snippets along with explanations. Below is an overview of the sections covered in this repository:

## Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

- **Linear Regression (Single and Multivariate)**: Implementing linear regression from scratch using gradient descent and normal equation. Analyzing correlations between features and visualizing results.

- **Logistic Regression**: Implementing logistic regression with regularization. Evaluating the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Neural Network

- **Neural Network Implementation**: Building a basic neural network from scratch using the sigmoid activation function. Training the network and evaluating its performance on the Breast Cancer dataset.

## K-means Clustering

- **K-means Clustering**: Applying K-means clustering algorithm to the Iris dataset. Visualizing the process of centroids convergence and the final cluster assignments.

Each section includes code snippets along with explanations to help you understand and implement these machine learning and data analysis techniques. Feel free to explore each section's folder for more details.
